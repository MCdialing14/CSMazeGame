# CS Maze Game
A maze game I made using an Arduino kit. I used the LCD screen, joystick, 7-seg display, and passive buzzer in my kit to make the functional game. The player is given about 10 seconds, or how long the 8-bit song plays on the buzzer, to complete the maze without bumping any walls or running out of time. The LCD screen displays the instructions, the game, and the multiple ending screens.
