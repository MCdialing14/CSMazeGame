# CSMazeGame
A maze game I made using an Arduino kit. The parts I used are the LCD screen, joystick, and passive buzzer. The player is given about 10 seconds, or how long the 8-bit song plays on the buzzer, to complete the maze without bumping any walls or running out of time. The LCD screen displays the instructions, the game, and the multiple ending screens.
